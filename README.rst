NI USB DAQ DATALOGGER & MONITOR
===============================
This software provides data logging capabilities and real-time plotting
of incoming data from a NI USB DAQ hooked up with an ATI FT sensor. The
3D plot shows the position of a plane flying tethered to
the FT sensor. The 2D plot displays the forces
measured by the sensor in the style of an oscilloscope.
